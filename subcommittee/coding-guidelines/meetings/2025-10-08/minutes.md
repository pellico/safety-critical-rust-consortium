  * [`coding guideline`](https://github.com/orgs/rustfoundation/projects/1/views/5) view

## **Tasks**

* Is there a rule about type inference in Misra C++ ?   
* \[Pete\] Which is the strategy regarding the rule checking between Clippy and Rust compiler ?

## **Meeting Minutes**

* [Previous Meeting Minutes](https://github.com/rustfoundation/safety-critical-rust-consortium/blob/main/subcommittee/coding-guidelines/meetings/2025-10-01/minutes.md) accepted  
* Introduction of new members:  
  * Daniel Kripper   
  * Lachlan Dowling  
  * William Barsse  
  * Max Jacinto Mestanza  
* Global Virtual Meetup  
  * Discussed information location (see agenda)  
  * Request to discuss with our organization on funding in person meetup.  
  * Presented agenda. If members have topics, it is possible to allocate them.  
* Launch milestone & Kanban board  
  * Open for contribution. Milestone reviewed.  
  * Kanban board presented.   
* Review Clippy lint  
  * David and Felix worked on which rules of Clippy can be useful.  
  * Presented a spreadsheet that is used to track the Clippy rule activity.  
  * Most of "suspicious" could become a good guideline rule.  
  * Some of the Clippy rules look like they address uncommon situations. Focus on useful rules. Red rules (not good rules), green good rules.  
  * Question: Do we need a general coding guidelines rule about type inference ? ‚Üí Maybe a recommendation  
  * Question which is the strategy about warnings check in Clippy and compiler:  
    * Deprecated language features goes in compiler  
    * Performance rules to Clippy  
    * When a suspicious/correctness rule is stabilized, it could be moved from Clippy to Rust compiler  
* Discuss collaboration with ANSSI regarding their Secure Rust Coding   
  * There is an overlap with safety coding guidelines.  
  * The license is strange.  
  * It is not possible to be safe without being secure. ‚Üí Make sense to have one guideline.  
* Round table  
  * Big appreciation of the presentation [Rust@Rivian](https://youtu.be/3RIxy9YE-Yk?list=PL2b0df3jKKiRFEuVNk76ufXagOgEJ9sBZ). Wish to have more companies coming out on Rust usage.
